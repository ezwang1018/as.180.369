In studying attainment gaps in education and the labor market, most research focuses on broad racial categories. However, less attention has been given to the differences within these groups. For example, among individuals who identify as the same race, there can be significant attainment gaps between ethnic groups. 
This is both puzzling and fascinatingâ€”why do groups that seem similar still experience different outcomes?
Understanding these gaps at a more granular level can help policymakers design targeted policies to better address the needs of specific ethnic groups, rather than assuming uniform experiences across a broad racial category.
To explore this, I propose two potential research directions. First, we could focus on the U.S. using data from the American Community Survey. 
We could analyze attainment differences within ethnic groups, such as between different Asian communities, looking at factors like English proficiency and educational achievements. Existing research on Hispanic and non-Hispanic attainment differences can serve as a model for this analysis.
Alternatively, we could take a global approach and analyze data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). 
This would allow us to compare educational outcomes across students from different Asian countries.
While establishing causality is challenging due to unobservable factors, we can potentially use variables in ACS or PISA data to predict educational attainment within ethnic groups. 
This could provide valuable insights for addressing disparities.
