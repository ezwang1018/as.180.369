               premium on two types of days. The first is under Democratic
               administrations. The second is on scheduled macroeconomic news
               announcement days. The current study unifies the two strands of
               literature by documenting that statistically significant and
               economically large announcement-day U.S. equity premiums have
               been limited to periods of Democratic administration between 1964
               and 2015. On announcement days in Republican administrations, the
               estimated equity premium accompanying news announcements was
               negligible. The Democratic announcement-day equity premium was
               consistently positive in sub-periods; it showed up in
               international markets; it increased as election day approached;
               it appeared to be stronger for announcements in successive
               Democratic administrations; and it was bigger for medium and
               large market cap stocks than for small market caps stocks on
               announcement days, even though small stocks have in general
               beaten large stocks under Democratic presidents. At the same
               time, we show that FOMC announcements in the 1990-2015 sub-period
               were associated with positive equity premiums in both Democratic
               (Clinton and Obama) and Republican (G.W. Bush) administrations;
               and also that macroeconomic announcements impacted Treasury bond
               returns primarily in Republican administrations.",

               used by the NBER to date business cycles and compares the
               performance of these economic indicators between presidential
               election and non-election years since 1960. Our results suggest
               that the general argument that uncertainty during presidential
               election years results in slower economic activity does not hold
               water. In fact, based on our analysis, we find that several
               measures of economic activity are actually stronger during
               presidential election years.",

  abstract  = "This paper examines the extent to which the positive relationship
               between personal wealth and entry into entrepreneurship is due to
               financing constraints. I exploit a tax reform and use unique
               micro-data from Denmark to study how exogenous changes in the
               cost of external finance shape both the probability of entering
               entrepreneurship and the characteristics of those who become
               entrepreneurs. As expected, differences-in-differences estimates
               show that the entry rates for individuals who faced an increase
               in the cost of finance fell by 40\% relative to those whose cost
               of external finance was unchanged. However, while some of the
               fall in entry was due to less wealthy individuals with high human
               capital (confirming the presence of financing constraints), the
               greatest relative decline in entry came from individuals with
               lower human capital, many of whom were above median wealth. This
               finding suggests that an important part of the positive
               relationship between personal wealth and entrepreneurship may be
               driven by the fact that wealthy individuals with lower ability
               can start new businesses because they are less likely to face the
               disciplining effect of external finance.",
