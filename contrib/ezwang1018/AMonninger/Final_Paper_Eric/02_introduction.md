# Introduction
New business formation reflects a nation’s commitment to innovation, entrepreneurial vibrancy, and potential for economic growth. Policies governing taxes, loans, and business registration are often shaped by the incumbent administration’s political ideology, influencing entrepreneurs' decisions to launch new ventures. Notably, while the U.S. consistently ranks as one of the top three countries for entrepreneurship by various organizations {cite:t}`Unknown2016-pw`, it has also become increasingly politically polarized. A report by Pew Research Center shows that, as of 2014, 92% of Republicans were positioned to the right of the median Democrat, while 94% of Democrats were to the left of the median Republican. Additionally, partisan animosity had more than doubled since 1994, with each party harboring highly negative views of the other {cite:t}`Geiger2014-lo`. In 2024, with political polarization even more pronounced, understanding how political affiliation affects entrepreneurship is crucial for policymakers aiming to foster business activity and for entrepreneurs planning new ventures.

This study analyzes data from the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) spanning 1978 to 2021, which documents the number and proportion of new businesses among active businesses annually. During this period, Democrats and Republicans each held the presidency for six terms, represented by four individuals from each party. To examine the relationship between presidential political affiliation and business formation, I created a dummy variable for presidential affiliation (0 for Republican, 1 for Democratic) and mapped it against the business formation rate.

A significant challenge in this study is that while presidential policies may influence entrepreneurial activity, other factors such as economic cycles, interest rates, technological shifts, and global events also play critical roles. To address this, and in line with the approach of Blinder and Watson {cite:t}`Blinder2016-by`, I control for variables including real GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, corporate profits, population growth, and congressional composition to isolate the potential effects of presidential affiliation.

Just after the 2024 presidential election, understanding how presidential affiliation influences business formation offers timely and valuable insights.
