# Reaction to Dennett's article
I agree with Dennett's point that creating counterfeit people using AI poses significant risks to the security and privacy of our citizens if the "counterfeit" identity is not properly disclosed. I also agree that the entities that created these counterfeit people should be held liable. How these entities can be held liable is, however, a challenge in technology and legislation. I think there are two main approaches: one is to prevent "evil" counterfeit people from coming into existence, and the other one is to mitigate their harm if they still manage to come into existence. Moreover, I believe counterfeit people, when properly managed, also present opportunities in many aspects of life. This has already been seen in the field of customer services, where "fake people" with a real human feel are able to do the job with great accuracy and efficiency.

Prompt to GPT: Below are my thoughts in response to the article in this link: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/. My goal is to have a final draft that is more than 500 words in length, how should I expand on this first draft to produce a second draft? 

In “The Problem with Counterfeit People,” Daniel Dennett raises concerns about “counterfeit people,” individuals generated by AI, in terms of their risks to privacy and security. First, I agree that the “counterfeit people” could pose such risks when their “counterfeit” identity is not properly disclosed. Therefore, in order to address such risks, we need to hold the creators of these counterfeit people accountable. However, given the rapid development of AI technology and gaps in current legislation, there are challenges when it comes to upholding such accountability. 

For example, speaking on the technology-derived challenge, one potential danger about counterfeit people that Dennett points out is that they can manipulate users’ consent. Specifically, by acting as someone indistinguishable from a real human, counterfeit people nudge users to invoke their natural inclination to treat anything that seems to talk sensibly with us as a person, even if when it is not. Driven by this natural inclination, users tend to overtrust counterfeit people and thus consent to what is presented by them when it actually requires further scrutiny. Speaking on the challenge relevant to legislation, to this day, many regulations mainly deal with the collection and use of personal data. However, I think counterfeit people may fall outside of the boundary of these regulations as AI-generated entities may not involve any use of real personal data. As a result, counterfeit people may be able to circumvent the current regulations and make regulatory enforcement difficult. 

To address the challenges previously discussed, I believe there are two main approaches: one is to prevent "evil" counterfeit people from coming into existence, and the other one is to mitigate their harm if they still manage to come into existence. On the first approach, we need to develop AI-specific regulations through legislation as soon as possible. First, these regulations should clearly define the boundary in which counterfeit people are held accountable. Moreover, these regulations should ensure that the identities of counterfeit people are disclosed to the extent that users are fully informed when making decisions in response to an interaction with counterfeit people. On the second approach, I think the best way is to use technology to “tame” the technology. Specifically, we can develop a technology that automatically detects evil counterfeit people when they engage in illegal activities, as ruled by the aforementioned AI-specific regulations, just like how AI technology is currently used to detect students’ misuse of ChatGPT in an academic environment. The difference, though, is that instead of dealing with a real person’s misuse, we are now concerned with a counterfeit person’s misuse, which is another level of complexity that needs to be addressed by even more complex technological solutions. 

In the above, we’ve discussed what we can do in the face of the dark side of counterfeit people in light of Daniel Dennett’s article. With that said, I do believe that there’s also a bright side to counterfeit people when managed properly. The real human feel of AI-derived people presents many opportunities in many aspects of our daily lives. This has already been seen in the field of customer services, where "fake people" with a real human feel are able to do the job with great accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, again, I believe that instead of putting all counterfeit people into prison, we need to learn to coexist with them – there is still a long way to go to answer the question of “how.”
