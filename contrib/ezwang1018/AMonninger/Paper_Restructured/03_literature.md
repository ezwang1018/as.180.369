# Literature Review
This is the place where you should write your literature review.

The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market performance, and unemployment rates. One foundational study is Douglas Hibbs' Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977) {cite:t}`Hibbs1977-ug`, which analyzes how political ideologies shape economic outcomes. Using data from 12 Western European and North American nations, Hibbs demonstrates that left-leaning governments, such as the U.S. Democratic Party and the U.K. Labour Party, prioritize employment over inflation control. In contrast, right-leaning governments, including the Republican Party and the Conservatives, emphasize inflation control even at the expense of higher unemployment. Hibbs’ work set a precedent for understanding the impact of political leadership on economic outcomes.

Building on these insights, Blinder and Watson (2016) {cite:t}`Blinder2016-by` analyze U.S. economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents through the lens of GDP growth. They find that GDP growth is consistently higher under Democratic administrations, though much of this disparity remains unexplained by fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, external factors like oil shocks, productivity changes, and consumer sentiment may account for up to 56% of the growth gap.

Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) {cite:t}`Santa-Clara2003-kw`also explore political leadership’s influence on economic outcomes. Their study, The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market, finds that stock market returns are higher under Democratic presidents without a corresponding increase in risk. The authors attribute this outcome to unexpected policy shocks that positively surprise market participants.

More recently, Boumans et al. (2021) {cite:t}`Boumans2021-cr` conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine how U.S. presidential elections shape the economic expectations of international experts. They found that Joe Biden’s election raised 2021 growth expectations by 0.98 percentage points, though this optimism quickly diminished as uncertainty rose. This suggests that the Democratic-Republican growth gap is not only a domestic reality but also an international expectation.

While prior research has largely focused on macroeconomic indicators, there is limited work exploring how political affiliation influences entrepreneurship. Nanda (2008) {cite:t}`Ramana2008-ho` found that tax reforms increasing the cost of external financing can deter entrepreneurship, especially for individuals with limited wealth. However, few studies address how presidential affiliation directly affects business formation. My study seeks to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between presidential political affiliation and new business creation.
