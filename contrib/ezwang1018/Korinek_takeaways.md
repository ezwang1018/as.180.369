commit #2:
prompt: This is my first-draft reflection on how this paper in pdf sheds light on the applications of GenAI in my own research project. I want to elaborate more and make it > 300 words, how should I improve on the first draft?

A lot of situations in which Korinek believes GenAI plays a role apply to my experience in economics research as well. Below are some cases where I can take advantage of GenAI for my final research project. 

First, during the planning stage, reading an economics paper with complex theoretical models that are far beyond my mathematical knowledge can be a challenging task. Here, I can ask ChatGPT to explain the models using more intuitive words. This kind of interaction with ChatGPT can help me grasp the gist of the research setup without having to dig into hardcore math, allowing me to have a more strategic and insightful engagement with the literature. 

Second, during the brainstorming stage, my own ideas can, at times, feel constrained in creativity and scope. Here, I can use ChatGPT to brainstorm research ideas because it incorporates the ideas of hundreds of millions of people on the same topic. Whatâ€™s more, ChatGPT can sort out the logic behind my research ideas, proposing thought-provoking mechanisms behind the causality found in my data analysis. Interactions with GenAI at this stage offer unexpected possibilities that may bring my research to the next level. 

Third, during the data analysis stage, when writing codes and analyzing empirical data, I often face challenges in recalling exact syntax or structuring scripts for different programming languages. Here, I can ask ChatGPT to create a code template, which I can then adapt to the specific needs of my research. Building on this, I can correct its mistakes and make changes in the code to adjust to the specific research task I work on. This kind of interaction saves me time from memorizing code syntaxes and focusing on the interpretation and analysis of results. GenAI helps me with prioritization, which can be particularly meaningful when working under tight deadlines.
