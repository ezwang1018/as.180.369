A lot of situations in which Korinek believes GenAI play a decent role apply to my experience in economics research as well. Below are some cases where I most often seek help from GenAI. First, when I read an economics paper with complex theoretical models that is far beyond my mathematical knowledge, I often asks ChatGPT to explain the models using more intuitive words. This kind of interaction helps me a lot grasp the gists of the research setup without having to dig into real analysis. Second, when I write codes for empirical data analysese, whether it be in Stata in my research asistantship work or in Python in this classwork, I often ask ChatGPT to lay out a template of the code. Bulding on this, I correct mistakes and make changes in the code to adjust to the specific context in which I am concerned. This kind of interaction saves my time from memorizing and recalling code syntacies and commands, allowing me to allocate my energy to more important tasks. Third, I also use ChatGPT to brainstorm research ideas and sort out the logic behind my research ideas by closing the gaps in my proposed causal mechanisms.
