# Introduction
The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been studied through various lens, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market returns, and unemployment. Douglas Hibbs’ foundational work on Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977) offers a compelling account of the differential outcome differentials driven by the incumbent administration’s political ideologies. Using data from 12 nations in West Europe and North America, Hibbs observes that Democratic governments in the U.S. and Labour governments in the UK (the Left) typically prioritize reducing unemployment, often at the cost of higher inflation. In contrast, Republican and Conservative governments (the Right) focus on controlling inflation, even if it leads to higher unemployment rates. Hibbs’ research empirically highlights the intricacies between political ideologies and inflation-unemployment management, setting a precedent for considering how political leadership may influence broader economic outcomes. Blinder and Watson (2016) build on Hibbs’ analysis in their paper Presidents and the U.S. Economy: An Econometric Exploration, where they analyze economic performance measured by real GDP growth under Democratic and Republican presidencies. Their econometric investigation reveals that real GDP growth is significantly higher during Democratic administrations compared to Republican ones. Interestingly, they argue that this partisan gap in economic performance cannot be attributed solely to differences in fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, they suggest that external factors such as oil shocks, productivity differences, and consumer expectations might explain the superior performance under Democrats. These factors together explain up to 56 percent of the D-R growth gap, whereas the rest remains a mystery. Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003), in their study The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market, further expand the exploration of the political-economic dynamics by studying the effects of incumbent president’s political affiliation on stock market returns. Their research demonstrates that stock market returns are significantly higher under Democratic presidencies than under Republican ones, with no corresponding increase in risk. The authors attribute this difference primarily to unexpected returns, suggesting that the market is often positively surprised by Democratic policies. In a more recent empirical study, Dorine Boumans, et al. (2021) conducted an RCT examine how the US president influences economic expectations of international experts. Their results show that the election of Joe Biden increased growth expectations of international experts by 0.98 percentage points for the year 2021. However, treatment effects materialize only in the short-run and experts’ uncertainty increased after the election. This research testifies the idea that the D-R growth gap is not only a domestic reality within the US, but also an expectation held at the international level. Another strand of research connects the dots between government policy and entrepreneurship. For instance, Ramana Nanda (2008) found that tax reforms that raise the cost of external financing tend to decrease entrepreneurship, particularly among individuals with lower human capital and wealth. However, few research has directly explored the relationship between the incumbent president’s political orientation and new business formation. My study aims to close this gap.

The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market performance, and unemployment rates. One foundational study is Douglas Hibbs' Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977), which presents a comprehensive analysis of how political ideologies shape economic outcomes. Using data from 12 Western European and North American nations, Hibbs demonstrates that left-leaning governments, such as the Democratic Party in the U.S. and the Labour Party in the U.K., prioritize reducing unemployment, often at the expense of higher inflation. Conversely, right-leaning governments, like the Republican Party and the Conservatives, focus on controlling inflation, even if it results in higher unemployment. Hibbs’ work sets a precedent for examining how political leadership influences broader economic trends, particularly in inflation and unemployment management.

Building on Hibbs' insights, Blinder and Watson (2016), in their paper Presidents and the U.S. Economy: An Econometric Exploration, analyze economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidencies, specifically through the lens of real GDP growth. Their econometric findings reveal that real GDP growth is significantly higher during Democratic administrations compared to Republican ones. However, they argue that this partisan gap in economic performance cannot be explained entirely by differences in fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, external factors such as oil shocks, productivity fluctuations, and consumer sentiment may account for up to 56% of the growth disparity, with the remaining gap still unexplained.

Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) also explore the influence of political leadership on economic outcomes in their study, The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market. They find that stock market returns are notably higher under Democratic presidents than under Republican ones, without a corresponding increase in risk. The authors suggest that these higher returns are largely due to unexpected shocks, where market participants are positively surprised by Democratic policies.

More recently, Boumans et al. (2021) conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate how the U.S. president influences the economic expectations of international experts. Their findings indicate that Joe Biden’s election increased growth expectations for 2021 by 0.98 percentage points, although this effect was short-lived, and uncertainty among experts rose following the election. This research suggests that the Democratic-Republican growth gap is not only a domestic reality but also an expectation at the international level.

Another strand of research connects the dots between government policy and entrepreneurship. Nanda (2008), for example, found that tax reforms increasing the cost of external financing can deter entrepreneurship, particularly among individuals with less human capital and wealth. However, there remains a notable gap in the literature when it comes to the direct relationship between the political affiliation of the U.S. president and new business formation. My study aims to address this gap, contributing to the existing body of research by investigating how the political affiliation of incumbent presidencies may influence the rate of business creation.

Prompt: I am writing the introduction part of my economics class paper that examines the relationship between the amount of business formation and the political affiliation of the incumbent US president. What do I need to write more about in this section? 

The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market performance, and unemployment rates. One foundational study is Douglas Hibbs' Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977), which presents a comprehensive analysis of how political ideologies shape economic outcomes.

Conversely, right-leaning governments, like the Republican Party and the Conservatives, focus on controlling inflation, even if it results in higher unemployment. Hibbs’ work sets a precedent for examining how political leadership influences broader economic trends, particularly in inflation and unemployment management.

Building on Hibbs' insights, Blinder and Watson (2016), in their paper Presidents and the U.S. Economy: An Econometric Exploration, analyze economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidencies, specifically through the lens of real GDP growth. Their econometric findings reveal that real GDP growth is significantly higher during Democratic administrations compared to Republican ones. However, they argue that this partisan gap in economic performance cannot be explained entirely by differences in fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, external factors such as oil shocks, productivity fluctuations, and consumer sentiment may account for up to 56% of the growth disparity, with the remaining gap still unexplained.

Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) also explore the influence of political leadership on economic outcomes in their study, The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market. They find that stock market returns are notably higher under Democratic presidents than under Republican ones, without a corresponding increase in risk.

This research suggests that the Democratic-Republican growth gap is not only a domestic reality but also an expectation at the international level.

Another strand of research connects the dots between government policy and entrepreneurship. Nanda (2008), for example, found that tax reforms increasing the cost of external financing can deter entrepreneurship, particularly among individuals with less human capital and wealth. 

However, there remains a notable gap in the literature when it comes to the direct relationship between the political affiliation of the U.S. president and new business formation. My study aims to address this gap, contributing to the existing body of research by investigating how the political affiliation of incumbent presidencies may influence the rate of business creation. The amount of business formation is a key indicator of the country’s commitment to innovation, entrepreneurial vibrancy, and potential for economic growth. Policy apparatuses relevant to new business formation such as taxes, registration fees, and loans, in fact, can be largely driven by the political ideology underlying the incumbent administration. Therefore, investigating the connection between presidential affiliation and entrepreneurship can provide insights for policymakers seeking to foster business activity and for entrepreneurs considering the economic environment as they launch ventures. 

In my study, I utilize the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by the US Census Bureau, which documents number of the new businesses established as well as the proportion of new businesses established out of the total active businesses each year from 1978 to 2021. Over the same period, 4 presidents were Democrat, and 4 were Republican; in total, Democrat and Republican presidents took 6 terms, respectively. To examine the relationship between the incumbent president’s political affiliation and a number of new business formations, I create a dummy variable with 0 representing Republican and 1 representing Democratic and then map such dummy variable with the new business establishment rate.  

A major challenge of my study is while it is possible that presidential policies influence entrepreneurial activity, many external factors—such as economic cycles, interest rates, technological shifts, and global economic events—also shape business formation. To address this challenge, I referenced to the method employed by Blinder and Watson, controlling for real GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, real interest rates, corporate tax rates, population growth, and the composition of Congress (House and Senate majorities) in my regression model. 

With economic recovery efforts post-COVID-19 and heated debates about government support for small businesses just a month ahead of the 2024 presidential election, understanding the dynamics between presidential political affiliation and business formation can offer valuable insights into the ongoing discussions.

The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market performance, and unemployment rates. One foundational study is Douglas Hibbs' Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977), which analyzes how political ideologies shape economic outcomes. Using data from 12 Western European and North American nations, Hibbs demonstrates that left-leaning governments, such as the U.S. Democratic Party and the U.K. Labour Party, prioritize employment over inflation control. In contrast, right-leaning governments, including the Republican Party and the Conservatives, emphasize inflation control even at the expense of higher unemployment. Hibbs’ work set a precedent for understanding the impact of political leadership on economic outcomes.

Building on these insights, Blinder and Watson (2016) analyze U.S. economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents through the lens of GDP growth. They find that GDP growth is consistently higher under Democratic administrations, though much of this disparity remains unexplained by fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, external factors like oil shocks, productivity changes, and consumer sentiment may account for up to 56% of the growth gap.

Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) also explore political leadership’s influence on economic outcomes. Their study, The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market, finds that stock market returns are higher under Democratic presidents without a corresponding increase in risk. The authors attribute this outcome to unexpected policy shocks that positively surprise market participants.

More recently, Boumans et al. (2021) conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine how U.S. presidential elections shape the economic expectations of international experts. They found that Joe Biden’s election raised 2021 growth expectations by 0.98 percentage points, though this optimism quickly diminished as uncertainty rose. This suggests that the Democratic-Republican growth gap is not only a domestic reality but also an international expectation.

While prior research has largely focused on macroeconomic indicators, there is limited work exploring how political affiliation influences entrepreneurship. Nanda (2008) found that tax reforms increasing the cost of external financing can deter entrepreneurship, especially for individuals with limited wealth. However, few studies address how presidential affiliation directly affects business formation. My study seeks to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between presidential political affiliation and new business creation.

New business formation reflects a nation’s commitment to innovation, entrepreneurial vibrancy, and potential for economic growth. Policies governing taxes, loans, and business registration are often shaped by the incumbent administration’s political ideology, influencing entrepreneurs' decisions to launch new ventures. Therefore, understanding how political affiliation affects entrepreneurship can provide useful insights for policymakers seeking to promote business activity and for entrepreneurs evaluating economic conditions.

This study draws on the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) from 1978 to 2021, which documents the number and proportion of new businesses among active businesses each year. Over this period, Democrats and Republicans each held the presidency for six terms by four people. I create a dummy variable to represent presidential affiliation (0 for Republican, 1 for Democratic) and map it against the business formation rate. 
A major challenge of my study is while it is possible that presidential policies influence entrepreneurial activity, many external factors—such as economic cycles, interest rates, technological shifts, and global economic events—also shape business formation. To address this challenge, following Blinder and Watson’s approach, I control for real GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, real interest rates, corporate tax rates, population growth, and congressional composition to isolate the relationship between political affiliation and entrepreneurship.

Amid post-COVID-19 recovery efforts and debates on small business support ahead of the 2024 election, understanding how presidential affiliation influences business formation offers timely and valuable insights.
