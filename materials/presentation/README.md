## Class 13

**Agenda**
- Presentations
    - Students will present (15 mins.) on their papers.
    - Include polished visuals to help convey your assertions.
    - 10 minutes per student + 5 min Q&A + 5 min allocation (×7 students = 140 min)

- Set computers up for miniconda.
    - Windows WSL https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install 
    - Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/

- Prepare your sciserver Fork:
    - Create a file of YOUR environment:
        - In your paper directory
        - Create a folder: binder 
            ```
            mkdir binder
            cd binder
            ```
        - create the environment file: This will create a file with all installed packages
            ```
            conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml
            ```
        - get the specified versions:
          ```
            conda list | grep -E -i -w "^$(conda env export --no-builds --from-history | awk '$1 == "-"{ if (key == "dependencies:") print $NF; next } {key=$1}' | sed 's/=.*//' | tr -s '\r\n' '|' | sed 's/|$//')\s" | awk '{ print $1 "=" $2 }' | sed 's/^/  - /'
          ```
        - replace the packages with the list on your terminal.
        - delete line for jupyterlab-rise=0.42.0
    
    - Adjust reproduce.sh (see [example](../../contrib/AMonninger/Paper_Restructured/reproduce.sh))
        - make sure to activate the kernel
        ```
        python -m ipykernel install --user --name econark
        ```
    - Push changes on GitHub

- On your laptop
    - Get your fork
        - Create a folder structure (Github/GitHubID)
        - In that newly created folder:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/GITHUBID/as.380.369
        ```
    - Give permission to execute reproduce.sh (If you have a mac):
        - open a terminal and navigate to folder of your paper
        - ```ls -las``` (shows if it is executable)
        - ```chmod u+x reproduce.sh ```
        - ```ls -las```(reproduce.sh file should be green now)
    - to get jupyterlab-rise working (for your slideshows):
        - ```conda uninstall httpx```
        - ```conda install "httpx<0.28.0```
        - ```jupyter lab```
        - once jupyter lab opens, click the extensions(puzzle piece) button on the left hand menu bar
        - type "rise" into the extensions search bar
        - install jupyterlab-rise
    - run reproduce.sh

If you want to run your code without reproduce.sh
- Creat the environment (only need to do this once)
  ```
  conda env create -f ./binder/environment.yml
  ```
- Activate the environment:
  ```
  activate econark
  ```
- run myst start or just build the pdf
  ```
  # to start
  myst start
  # to build
  myst build --pdf
  ```
- Alternatively: Launch Jupyter Lab and view paper & presentation draft locally.
