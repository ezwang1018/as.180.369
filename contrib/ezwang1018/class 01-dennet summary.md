# Reaction to Dennett's article
I agree with Dennett's point that creating counterfeit people using AI poses significant risks to the security and privacy of our citizens if the "counterfeit" identity is not properly disclosed. I also agree that the entities that created these counterfeit people should be held liable. How these entities can be held liable is, however, a challenge in technology and legislation. I think there are two main approaches: one is to prevent "evil" counterfeit people from coming into existence, and the other one is to mitigate their harm if they still manage to come into existence. Moreover, I believe counterfeit people, when properly managed, also present opportunities in many aspects of life. This has already been seen in the field of customer services, where "fake people" with a real human feel are able to do the job with great accuracy and efficiency.
