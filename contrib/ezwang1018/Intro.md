The relationship between political affiliation and economic outcomes has long been a topic of scholarly interest, with much focus placed on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market returns, and unemployment rates. Douglas Hibbs’ foundational study, Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977), set a precedent by illustrating how left-leaning governments, such as the U.S. Democratic Party, often prioritize employment at the expense of inflation control. In contrast, right-leaning governments, including the Republican Party, tend to emphasize inflation control, even if it leads to higher unemployment. Hibbs’ findings underscore the complex trade-offs inherent in different political ideologies and their economic impacts.

Building on these insights, Blinder and Watson (2016) analyze U.S. economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents, with a particular focus on GDP growth. Their findings suggest that GDP growth has consistently been higher under Democratic administrations, though much of this disparity remains unexplained by traditional fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, the gap appears influenced by external factors, such as oil shocks, productivity shifts, and consumer sentiment, which could account for up to 56% of the difference.

Similarly, Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) explore the “Presidential Puzzle” regarding stock market cycles, finding that market returns are higher under Democratic presidents without an associated increase in risk. The authors attribute this to unexpected policy developments that tend to positively surprise market participants, offering further evidence of the unpredictable nature of political influence on economic performance.

More recently, Boumans et al. (2021) conducted a randomized controlled trial examining how U.S. presidential elections shape the economic expectations of international experts. Their study revealed that Joe Biden’s election led to a short-term boost in growth expectations for 2021, though this optimism quickly faded as uncertainty grew. This suggests that international economic expectations, like domestic ones, may shift with U.S. presidential elections and their accompanying political signals.

While prior research has provided valuable insights into how political affiliation influences broad economic metrics, there has been limited attention to its specific impact on new business formation—a key driver of innovation and long-term economic growth. Business creation signals entrepreneurial vibrancy and reflects a nation’s capacity for economic adaptation, making it a particularly valuable measure of economic health. This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by examining how the political affiliation of the U.S. president influences the rate of new business formation, providing insights for both policymakers and entrepreneurs.

Understanding the impact of political affiliation on entrepreneurship is particularly relevant, as presidential policies often shape the tax, loan, and regulatory landscape that entrepreneurs navigate. By influencing the cost of capital, market access, and regulatory burdens, these policies can encourage or discourage new business creation. Therefore, studying this relationship not only illuminates the indirect effects of political leadership on the entrepreneurial landscape but also provides insights for fostering economic dynamism.

Drawing on the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) data from 1978 to 2021, which captures business formation metrics across both Democratic and Republican administrations, this study introduces a dummy variable (0 for Republican, 1 for Democratic) to assess how political party affiliation correlates with the rate of new business creation. Recognizing the multitude of external factors that may influence entrepreneurial activity—such as economic cycles, technological shifts, and global events—I follow Blinder and Watson’s approach by controlling for variables like real GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, real interest rates, corporate tax rates, population growth, and congressional composition.

My findings show that controlling for real GDP growth, corporate profit after tax, population growth, and unemployment rate, having a Democrat president in the office leads to a 0.46 units decrease, statistically significantly at the 0.1 significance level in the new business formation rate in the US. This suggests that under Democratic administrations, policies and economic conditions may create an environment that slightly dampens the rate of new business creation. This trend might indicate that certain Democratic policies or priorities have nuanced effects on entrepreneurial activity. Understanding the mechanism of this effect invites further research. 

In a time when post-COVID-19 economic recovery and small business support remain central topics, understanding how political cycles impact new business formation offers timely and valuable insights. This study not only enhances our understanding of the connection between political leadership and entrepreneurial activity but also provides a nuanced perspective for policymakers and business leaders navigating today’s evolving economic landscape.
