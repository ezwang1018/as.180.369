prompt: I want to use this paragraph for a 3-min pitch in my economic research class. How can I improve it to make it more aligned with my audience?
In the U.S., immigration policy debates often center around whether immigrants benefit or harm the economy. 
While skilled immigration is thought to boost firm performance and innovation, empirical evidence on this is mixed. Moreover, immigration can create winners and losers, making its economic effects uneven. 
My research can move forward in two directions. First, I plan to update existing studies to test whether recent immigration trends still show the same economic patterns. 
Second, I will examine the impact of reclassifying Economics as a STEM majorâ€”specifically, how this policy change affects international students' academic decisions.
Depending on available data, I hope to shed light on how these policies influence economic outcomes and student behavior.
