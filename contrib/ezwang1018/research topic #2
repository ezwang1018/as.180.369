Ethnic group and attainment:
I am interested in this topic because while most existing research has studied the attainment gap in education and labor market by race, a few of them look at more granular ethnic groups. 
Nevertheless, even within the same race, there can be attainment gaps by ethnic groups. It’s both puzzling and interesting that things can be different when they “appear similar.” 
Understanding the attainment gap more in-depth and in-detail would help policymaker recognize the needs of different ethnic groups and formulate more efficient policy that promotes equality. 
With what I have in mind so far, there are two ways to move forward with this topic. First, we can focus our scope on the US. 
Specifically, using American Community Survey and other data sources, we can look at the differentials between different ethnic groups, for example, among Asian people, in their educational attainment measured by English proficiency, highest degree earned, etc. 
For this study, we can use existing literature that examined such differential between Hispanics and non-Hispanics as a template. 
Another option is to focus our scope at the global level. Specifically, we can use the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores to examine the differentials between students from different Asian countries participating in the program. 
Regardless which option we pick, it’s challenging to identify the causal determinants on such differentials due to unobservables. 
With that said, we might be able to take advantage of other variables in ACS or PISA to predict determinants of education attainment within one ethnic group.
