# Conclusion
While the impact of the political affiliation of U.S. presidents on macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth and stock returns has been extensively explored, the influence on new business formation has received less attention. In this paper, I utilized data from the Business Dynamics Statistics to conduct a multivariate regression analysis to investigate this relationship. After controlling for variables such as real GDP growth, population growth, corporate profits after tax adjusted by real GDP, and the unemployment rate, my findings indicate that having a Democratic president correlates with a 0.43 unit decrease in the business establishment entry rate. However, this coefficient is not statistically significant at the 10% level, suggesting that no definitive relationship exists between a president's political affiliation and entrepreneurial activity. Future research can focus less on political affiliation itself and more on how specific policies influence new business formation. As the U.S. approaches a presidential transition in 2025, this topic may continue to generate interest and scholarly debate.
