# Conclusion
While the impact of the political affiliation of U.S. presidents on macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth and stock returns has been extensively explored, its influence on new business formation has received less attention. This paper utilized data from the Business Dynamics Statistics to conduct a multivariate regression analysis investigating this relationship. After controlling for variables such as real GDP growth, population growth, corporate profits after tax adjusted for real GDP, the unemployment rate, and congressional composition, the findings indicate that having a Democratic president correlates with a 0.45 unit decrease in the business establishment entry rate. However, this coefficient is not statistically significant at the 5% level, suggesting no definitive relationship exists between a president's political affiliation and entrepreneurial activity in the U.S.

The lack of statistical significance suggests that future research could shift focus from the president's political affiliation to the specific policies influencing new business formation. Additionally, the impact of political orientation on entrepreneurs' investment choices has been explored in previous studies, but its influence on their decisions to start new businesses warrants further examination. Furthermore, future research could investigate how the rate of new business formation varies across industries and under different market structures, a topic inspired by unexpected findings in this study.

Overall, as the world faces increasing challenges in political and economic development, the interaction between political and economic variables should continue to stimulate scholarly interest.
