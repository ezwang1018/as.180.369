# Literature Review

The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market performance, and unemployment rates. One foundational study is Douglas Hibbs' Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977) {cite:t}`Hibbs1977-ug`, which analyzes how political ideologies shape economic outcomes. Using data from 12 Western European and North American nations, Hibbs demonstrates that left-leaning governments, such as the U.S. Democratic Party and the U.K. Labour Party, prioritize employment over inflation control. In contrast, right-leaning governments, including the Republican Party and the Conservatives, emphasize inflation control even at the expense of higher unemployment. Hibbs’ work set a precedent for understanding the impact of political leadership on economic outcomes. A similar ideology-based policy divergence is observed by Alesina and Sachs, who argue that different political parties have distinct policy preferences and priorities regarding inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. Using data from the post-World War II period in the United States, the authors demonstrate that Democratic administrations are generally more focused on output growth, while Republican administrations emphasize controlling inflation {cite:t}`Alesina1988-wj`. Besides the national level, research has also confirmed that Democratic governors implement somewhat more expansionary and liberal policies than Republican governors at the state level {cite:t}`Potrafke2018-da`. 

Building on these insights, Blinder and Watson (2016) {cite:t}`Blinder2016-by` analyze U.S. economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents through the lens of GDP growth. They find that GDP growth is consistently higher under Democratic administrations, though much of this disparity remains unexplained by fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, external factors like oil shocks, productivity changes, and consumer sentiment may account for up to 56% of the growth gap.

Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) {cite:t}`Santa-Clara2003-kw`also explore political leadership’s influence on economic outcomes. Their study, The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market, finds that stock market returns are higher under Democratic presidents without a corresponding increase in risk. A more recent research by {cite:t}`Pastor2017-ey` also supports this conclusion. The authors attribute this outcome to unexpected policy shocks that positively surprise market participants. 

More recently, Boumans et al. (2021) {cite:t}`Boumans2021-cr` conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine how U.S. presidential elections shape the economic expectations of international experts. They found that Joe Biden’s election raised 2021 growth expectations by 0.98 percentage points, though this optimism quickly diminished as uncertainty rose. This suggests that the Democratic-Republican growth gap is not only a domestic reality but also an international expectation.

While prior research has largely focused on macroeconomic indicators, there are fewer studies exploring how politics influences entrepreneurship. Nanda (2008) {cite:t}`Ramana2008-ho` found that tax reforms increasing the cost of external financing can deter entrepreneurship, especially for individuals with limited wealth. {cite:t}`Brieger2024-yv`'s paper is concerned about democracy and entrepreneurship, showing that key measures of entrepreneurship are frequently negatively, not positively, associated with democracy and its various determinants. What's more, by exploiting random variation in close gubernatorial elections in 50 states over the last three decades in a regression discontinuity design, {cite:t}`Beland2019-gb` and his coauthor demonstrate that Republican governors are no different than Democratic governors in their effects on entrepreneurship. However, few studies address how presidential affiliation directly affects business formation. My study seeks to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between presidential political affiliation and new business creation.


The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, with significant attention given to macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market performance, and unemployment rates.

In contrast, right-leaning governments, including the Republican Party and the Conservatives, focus on inflation control, even at the expense of higher unemployment. This study established a framework for understanding how political leadership impacts economic outcomes. Alesina and Sachs build on this premise, arguing that political parties in the United States have distinct policy preferences and priorities regarding inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. Their analysis of post-World War II U.S. data shows that Democratic administrations tend to prioritize output growth, whereas Republican administrations focus on inflation control {cite:t}`Alesina1988-wj`. Similarly, research at the state level confirms that Democratic governors implement somewhat more expansionary and liberal policies than their Republican counterparts {cite:t}`Potrafke2018-da`.

Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) extend the analysis to stock market performance in their study The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market. They find that stock market returns are higher under Democratic presidents without a corresponding increase in risk {cite:t}`Santa-Clara2003-kw`. Similarly, Pastor and Veronesi (2017) support this conclusion, attributing the outcome to unexpected policy shocks that positively surprise market participants {cite:t}`Pastor2017-ey`.

They found that Joe Biden’s election raised 2021 growth expectations by 0.98 percentage points, though this optimism quickly waned due to rising uncertainty {cite:t}`Boumans2021-cr`. This highlights that the Democratic-Republican growth gap is not merely a domestic phenomenon but also shapes international economic expectations.

However, few studies directly examine how presidential affiliation impacts business formation. My study seeks to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between presidential political affiliation and new business creation, providing a novel perspective on the intersection of politics and entrepreneurship.
