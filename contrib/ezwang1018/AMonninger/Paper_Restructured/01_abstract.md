The economic performance of the United States is often linked to the political affiliation of the incumbent presidents. However, while existing research has predominantly focused on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment, and stock market performance, limited attention has been given to new business formationâ€”a critical driver of economic vitality. This study addresses that gap by examining the relationship between presidential political affiliation and the annual rate of new business formation in the U.S. from 1978 to 2021, using data from the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by the U.S. Census Bureau. To mitigate endogeneity concerns, the analysis controls for key economic and political variables, including real GDP growth, corporate profits, unemployment, population growth, and congressional composition. The findings indicate that while Democratic administrations are negatively associated with new business formation, this relationship is not statistically significant at the 5% level. These results suggest that future research should focus less on presidential political affiliation and more on the influence of specific policies on new business formation in the U.S. Additionally, exploring sectoral variations in new business formation and the role of entrepreneurs' political ideologies in shaping entrepreneurial decisions could yield valuable insights.
