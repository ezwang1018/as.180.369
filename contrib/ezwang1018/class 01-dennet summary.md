# Reaction to Dennett's article
I agree with Dennett's point that creating counterfeit people using AI poses significant risks to the security and privacy of our citizens if the "counterfeit" identity is not properly disclosed. I also agree that the entities that created these counterfeit people should be held liable. How these entities can be held liable is, however, a challenge in technology and legislation. I think there are two main approaches: one is to prevent "evil" counterfeit people from coming into existence, and the other one is to mitigate their harm if they still manage to come into existence. Moreover, I believe counterfeit people, when properly managed, also present opportunities in many aspects of life. This has already been seen in the field of customer services, where "fake people" with a real human feel are able to do the job with great accuracy and efficiency.

Prompt to GPT: Below are my thoughts in response to the article in this link: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/. My goal is to have a final draft that is more than 500 words in length, how should I expand on this first draft to produce a second draft? 

In “The Problem with Counterfeit People,” Daniel Dennett raises concerns about “counterfeit people,” individuals generated by AI, in terms of their risks to privacy and security. First, I agree that the “counterfeit people” could pose such risks when their “counterfeit” identity is not properly disclosed. Therefore, in order to address such risks, we need to hold the creators of these counterfeit people accountable. However, given the rapid development of AI technology and gaps in current legislation, there are challenges when it comes to upholding such accountability. 

For example, speaking on the technology-derived challenge, one potential danger about counterfeit people that Dennett points out is that they can manipulate users’ consent. Specifically, by acting as someone indistinguishable from a real human, counterfeit people nudge users to invoke their natural inclination to treat anything that seems to talk sensibly with us as a person, even if when it is not. Driven by this natural inclination, users tend to overtrust counterfeit people and thus consent to what is presented by them when it actually requires further scrutiny. Speaking on the challenge relevant to legislation, to this day, many regulations mainly deal with the collection and use of personal data. However, I think counterfeit people may fall outside of the boundary of these regulations as AI-generated entities may not involve any use of real personal data. As a result, counterfeit people may be able to circumvent the current regulations and make regulatory enforcement difficult. 

To address the challenges previously discussed, I believe there are two main approaches: one is to prevent "evil" counterfeit people from coming into existence, and the other one is to mitigate their harm if they still manage to come into existence. On the first approach, we need to develop AI-specific regulations through legislation as soon as possible. First, these regulations should clearly define the boundary in which counterfeit people are held accountable. Moreover, these regulations should ensure that the identities of counterfeit people are disclosed to the extent that users are fully informed when making decisions in response to an interaction with counterfeit people. On the second approach, I think the best way is to use technology to “tame” the technology. Specifically, we can develop a technology that automatically detects evil counterfeit people when they engage in illegal activities, as ruled by the aforementioned AI-specific regulations, just like how AI technology is currently used to detect students’ misuse of ChatGPT in an academic environment. The difference, though, is that instead of dealing with a real person’s misuse, we are now concerned with a counterfeit person’s misuse, which is another level of complexity that needs to be addressed by even more complex technological solutions. 

In the above, we’ve discussed what we can do in the face of the dark side of counterfeit people in light of Daniel Dennett’s article. With that said, I do believe that there’s also a bright side to counterfeit people when managed properly. The real human feel of AI-derived people presents many opportunities in many aspects of our daily lives. This has already been seen in the field of customer services, where "fake people" with a real human feel are able to do the job with great accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, again, I believe that instead of putting all counterfeit people into prison, we need to learn to coexist with them – there is still a long way to go to answer the question of “how.”

Prompt: Below is my 2nd draft. Is it appropriate to say there are bright sides to counterfeit people? If so or if not, how should I improve my essay in the 3rd draft?

In “The Problem with Counterfeit People,” Daniel Dennett raises concerns about “counterfeit people” and the risks they pose to privacy, security, and independent human decision-making. I agree that counterfeit people can indeed threaten society when their counterfeit identity is not properly disclosed. To address such risks, it’s critical to hold the creators of these counterfeit people accountable. However, given the rapid development of AI technology and gaps in current legislation, achieving this accountability presents considerable challenges. 

One of the most concerning issues, as Dennett points out, is the ability of counterfeit people to manipulate users’ consent. By acting as someone indistinguishable from a real human, counterfeit people trigger our natural inclination to trust what feels sensible from a human perspective. Driven by this natural inclination, we tend to overtrust counterfeit people and thus consent to what is presented by them even when it actually requires further scrutiny. For example, a counterfeit person on the internet may convince someone to share sensitive information by acting as one of their close friends, without them realizing whom they interact with is not a real person at all. 

On the legislative side, many current regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), mainly deal with the collection and use of personal data. However, counterfeit people may circumvent these regulations, as they may not involve any use of real personal data at all. Such property of counterfeit people creates a new range of ethical and regulatory challenges. The absence of clear laws delineating the boundary in which counterfeit people interact with users makes regulatory enforcement difficult, leaving users unprotected by law.

To address the challenges previously discussed, I believe there are two main approaches: one is to prevent "evil" counterfeit people from coming into existence, and the other one is to mitigate their harm if they still manage to come into existence. In the first approach, we need to develop AI-specific regulations through legislation as soon as possible. First, these regulations should clearly define the boundary in which counterfeit people are held accountable. Moreover, these regulations should ensure that the identities of counterfeit people are disclosed to the extent that users are fully informed when making decisions in response to an interaction with counterfeit people. On the second approach, I think the best way is to use technology to “tame” the technology. Specifically, we can develop a technology that automatically detects evil counterfeit people when they engage in illegal activities, as ruled by the aforementioned AI-specific regulations, just like how AI technology is currently used to detect students’ misuse of ChatGPT in an academic environment. The difference, though, is that instead of dealing with a real person’s misuse, we are now concerned with a counterfeit person’s misuse, which is another level of complexity that needs to be addressed by even more complex technological solutions. 

While much of the discussion around counterfeit people focuses on their risks in Dennett’s article, I do believe that these AI-derived entities also present opportunities, when managed responsibly. One of the bright sides of counterfeit people is customer service. As we’ve already seen on the market, by being 24/7 on call and providing quick response with almost no wait time, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can handle large amounts of duties, even outperforming real humans in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Besides customer service, AI-derived people have also been playing a role in other industries. For instance, in education, AI teachers are helping students by offering personalized and more affordable tutorials; in healthcare, AI-derived therapists are taking care of patients who need long-term mental health support. 

The emergence of counterfeit people, without any doubt, creates challenges in protecting human beings’ privacy, security, and democracy. Addressing such challenges requires effort both in closing the legislative gaps and technological innovation. While AI-derived entities present promising opportunities in fields like customer service, education, and healthcare, their benefits can only be realized when we appropriately manage the risks. In addition to general guidelines that apply to counterfeit people as a whole, we may also need to customize solutions based on the unique industry or area in which counterfeit people exist.
