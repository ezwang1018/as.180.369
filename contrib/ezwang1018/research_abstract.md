# Research Abstract
prompt to GPT: I am writing the abstract for a paper that examined the amount of business creation by political affiliation of the incumbent US president. Am I missing anything in my first draft? How should I improve in my second draft? It is widely believed that there’s some link between the economic performance in the US and the political affiliation of an incumbent president. Particularly, many have observed that economic growth has been faster under Democratic presidencies. While research has studied the GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, international trade, stock market return, and equity market liquidity in relation to the incumbent president’s political affiliation, few has examined business creation as a dependent variable. In this study, Using data from Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by US Census Bureau, I first visualize the pattern of number of business creation from 1978 to 2021 in the US. Second, I regress the number of business creation in each year on a dummy variable describing whether the incumbent president is a Democrat or Republican in each year.

It is widely believed that the economic performance of the US is linked to the political affiliation of the incumbent president, with some evidence suggesting faster economic growth under Democratic presidencies. While prior research has extensively studied variables such as GDP growth, unemployment, and stock market returns, few have explored the role of business creation as a measure of economic vitality. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationship between the political affiliation of US presidents and the number of businesses created each year from 1978 to 2021, using data from the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by the US Census Bureau. To mitigate the omitted-variable bias, in my regression analysis, I control for real GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation rate, real interest rate, corporate tax rate, population growth rate, House majority party, and Senate majority party. The findings suggest… These results provide new insights into the intersection of politics and entrepreneurship, with implications for both economic policy and business strategies…![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8c5ab3d-5f13-498a-8545-c6c284078c32)
