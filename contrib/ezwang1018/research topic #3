Skilled Immigrants and firm outcomes:
In the US, there have been constant debates on immigration policies in light of whether immigrants benefit for harm the US economy. 
One pro-immigration argument is that skilled immigration can promote firm performance and foster innovation. 
However, the empirical evidence for this argument is ambiguous. In addition, there can be distributional effect of immigration that make somebody gains while somebody else loses. 
  To move forward with this topic, I have two options. First, I can replicate some existing research with updated data to test if the pattern and effect has changed. 
  Second, I can further examine the recent classification of Economics major as STEM major, which gives them more benefits in the job market. 
  I want to look at how this change in the policy affects international studentâ€™s academic choices, pending availability of data.
