commit #3:
Korinek’s insights on the applications of GenAI resonate strongly with my experience in economics research, particularly as I navigate different stages of my final project for this class. Below, I explore how GenAI enhances my work across planning, brainstorming, and data analysis, ultimately allowing me to produce more strategic and refined results.

During the planning stage, engaging with complex theoretical models in economics papers can be challenging, especially when the math is beyond my current knowledge. Here, ChatGPT serves as an invaluable tool, translating intricate models into more intuitive explanations. This support allows me to grasp the research structure and focus on strategic insights, preparing me for a deeper engagement with the literature without getting lost in technical details.

During the brainstorming stage, as Korinek suggests, GenAI can also broaden research ideation. When I need to expand the creativity and scope of my ideas, ChatGPT’s vast database sparks new directions for research and proposes thought-provoking mechanisms behind causality in my data findings. By clarifying logical structures, GenAI helps me strengthen the coherence of my ideas, often revealing perspectives I hadn’t considered.

During the data analysis stage, coding and empirical analysis often demand precise syntax and code structuring, the memorization of which can be time-consuming. Here, ChatGPT provides templates that I can adapt to specific tasks, saving me from memorizing syntax and allowing me to prioritize interpretation. This support, especially when time is tight, enables me to focus on analysis rather than logistics, bringing my research closer to completion with efficiency and precision.
