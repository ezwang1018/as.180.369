A lot of situations in which Korinek believes GenAI plays a decent role apply to my experience in economics research as well. Below are some cases where I can take advantage of GenAI for my final research project. First, when I read an economics paper with complex theoretical models that are far beyond my mathematical knowledge, I can ask ChatGPT to explain the models using more intuitive words. This kind of interaction can help me a lot grasp the gist of the research setup without having to dig into hard math. Second, when I write codes for empirical data analysis, I can ask ChatGPT to make a template of the code. Building on this, I can correct its mistakes and make changes in the code to adjust to the specific research task I work on. This kind of interaction saves me time from memorizing and recalling code syntaxes and commands in different programming languages, allowing me to allocate my energy to more important things. Third, I can use ChatGPT to brainstorm research ideas and sort out the logic behind my research ideas by closing the gaps in my proposed causal mechanisms.
