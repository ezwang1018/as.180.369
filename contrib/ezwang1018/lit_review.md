#Literature Review
The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been studied through various lens, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market returns, and unemployment. Douglas Hibbs’ foundational work on Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977) offers a compelling account of the differential outcome differentials driven by the incumbent administration’s political ideologies. Using data from 12 nations in West Europe and North America, Hibbs observes that Democratic governments in the U.S. and Labour governments in the UK (the Left) typically prioritize reducing unemployment, often at the cost of higher inflation. In contrast, Republican and Conservative governments (the Right) focus on controlling inflation, even if it leads to higher unemployment rates. Hibbs’ research empirically highlights the intricacies between political ideologies and inflation-unemployment management, setting a precedent for considering how political leadership may influence broader economic outcomes. Blinder and Watson (2016) build on Hibbs’ analysis in their paper Presidents and the U.S. Economy: An Econometric Exploration, where they analyze economic performance measured by real GDP growth under Democratic and Republican presidencies. Their econometric investigation reveals that real GDP growth is significantly higher during Democratic administrations compared to Republican ones. Interestingly, they argue that this partisan gap in economic performance cannot be attributed solely to differences in fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, they suggest that external factors such as oil shocks, productivity differences, and consumer expectations might explain the superior performance under Democrats. These factors together explain up to 56 percent of the D-R growth gap, whereas the rest remains a mystery. Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003), in their study The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market, further expand the exploration of the political-economic dynamics by studying the effects of incumbent president’s political affiliation on stock market returns. Their research demonstrates that stock market returns are significantly higher under Democratic presidencies than under Republican ones, with no corresponding increase in risk. The authors attribute this difference primarily to unexpected returns, suggesting that the market is often positively surprised by Democratic policies. In a more recent empirical study, Dorine Boumans, et al. (2021) conducted an RCT examine how the US president influences economic expectations of international experts. Their results show that the election of Joe Biden increased growth expectations of international experts by 0.98 percentage points for the year 2021. However, treatment effects materialize only in the short-run and experts’ uncertainty increased after the election. This research testifies the idea that the D-R growth gap is not only a domestic reality within the US, but also an expectation held at the international level. Another strand of research connects the dots between government policy and entrepreneurship. For instance, Ramana Nanda (2008) found that tax reforms that raise the cost of external financing tend to decrease entrepreneurship, particularly among individuals with lower human capital and wealth. However, few research has directly explored the relationship between the incumbent president’s political orientation and new business formation. My study aims to close this gap.
