# Introduction

Prompt: This is the introduction part of my research paper that studies the amount of new business formation in relation to the political affiliation of the incumbent US president. I want to talk more about how my research contributes to the literature gap. How should improve this draft?

The relationship between political orientation and economic outcomes has been extensively studied, with a notable focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, stock market performance, and unemployment rates. A foundational study in this field is Douglas Hibbs’ Political Parties and Macroeconomic Policy (1977), which analyzes how political ideologies shape economic outcomes. Using data from 12 Western European and North American nations, Hibbs demonstrates that left-leaning governments, such as the U.S. Democratic Party and the U.K. Labour Party, prioritize employment over inflation control. In contrast, right-leaning governments, including the Republican Party and the Conservatives, emphasize inflation control even at the expense of higher unemployment. Hibbs’ work marks the first step in understanding the impact of political leadership on economic outcomes.

Building on these insights, Blinder and Watson (2016) analyze U.S. economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents through the lens of GDP growth. They find that GDP growth is consistently higher under Democratic administrations, though much of this disparity remains unexplained by fiscal or monetary policy. Instead, external factors like oil shocks, productivity changes, and consumer sentiment may account for up to 56% of the growth gap. These findings suggest that while political affiliation may correlate with economic outcomes, the relationship is complex and influenced by external variables.

Similarly, Santa-Clara and Valkanov’s (2003) The Presidential Puzzle: Political Cycles and the Stock Market explores political leadership’s influence on economic outcomes, finding that stock market returns are higher under Democratic presidents without a corresponding increase in risk. The authors attribute this outcome to unexpected policy shocks that positively surprise market participants, further supporting the notion that external factors influence economic outcomes under different administrations.

More recently, Boumans et al. (2021) conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine how U.S. presidential elections shape the economic expectations of international experts. Their study found that Joe Biden’s election raised 2021 growth expectations by 0.98 percentage points, though this optimism quickly diminished as uncertainty rose. This suggests that the Democratic-Republican growth gap is not only a domestic reality but also an international expectation, influenced by shifts in global sentiment following U.S. elections.

While prior research has primarily focused on macroeconomic indicators, the specific impact of political affiliation on new business formation—a crucial driver of economic growth and innovation—remains largely underexplored. Business creation reflects a nation’s entrepreneurial vibrancy, adaptability, and long-term growth potential, all of which can be shaped by the policies enacted by the incumbent administration. My study aims to fill this literature gap by examining how presidential political affiliation affects the rate of new business formation, providing insights relevant to policymakers, entrepreneurs, and scholars alike.

Understanding the impact of political affiliation on business formation is particularly valuable, as policies governing taxes, loans, and business registration are often shaped by the political ideology of the administration in office. These policies, in turn, influence entrepreneurs’ decisions to launch new ventures, making the rate of new business formation a unique and timely indicator of the broader economic implications of political cycles. Thus, this study contributes to the literature by addressing how variations in political leadership might indirectly shape entrepreneurship and the economic landscape.

In my study, I utilize the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by the US Census Bureau, which documents number of the new businesses established as well as the proportion of new businesses established out of the total active businesses each year from 1978 to 2021. Over the same period, 4 presidents were Democrat and 4 were Republican; in total, Democrat and Republican presidents took 6 terms respectively. To examine the relationship between the incumbent president’s political affiliation and number of new business formation, I create a dummy variable with 0 representing Republican and 1 representing Democratic, and then map such dummy variable with new business establishment rate.  

A major challenge of my study is while it is possible that presidential policies influence entrepreneurial activity, many external factors—such as economic cycles, interest rates, technological shifts, and global economic events—also shape business formation. To address this challenge, I referenced to the method employed by Blinder and Watson, controlling for real GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, real interest rates, corporate tax rates, population growth, and the composition of Congress (House and Senate majorities) in my regression model. 

Amid post-COVID-19 recovery efforts and debates on small business support ahead of the 2024 election, understanding how presidential affiliation influences business formation offers timely and valuable insights.
