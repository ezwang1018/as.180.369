prompt to GPT: I am writing the abstract for a paper that examined the amount of business creation by political affiliation of the incumbent US president. Am I missing anything in my first draft? How should I improve in my second draft? It is widely believed that there’s some link between the economic performance in the US and the political affiliation of an incumbent president. Particularly, many have observed that economic growth has been faster under Democratic presidencies. While research has studied the GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, international trade, stock market return, and equity market liquidity in relation to the incumbent president’s political affiliation, few has examined business creation as a dependent variable. In this study, Using data from Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by US Census Bureau, I first visualize the pattern of number of business creation from 1978 to 2021 in the US. Second, I regress the number of business creation in each year on a dummy variable describing whether the incumbent president is a Democrat or Republican in each year. To mitigate the omitted-variable bias, in my regression, I control for real GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation rate, real interest rate, corporate tax rate, population growth rate, House majority party, and Senate majority party. The regression results show that… These findings shed light…

It is widely believed that the economic performance of the US is linked to the political affiliation of the incumbent president, with some evidence suggesting faster economic growth under Democratic presidencies. While prior research has extensively studied variables such as GDP growth, unemployment, and stock market returns, few have explored the role of business creation as a measure of economic vitality. This study addresses this gap by examining the relationship between the political affiliation of US presidents and the number of businesses created each year from 1978 to 2021, using data from the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by the US Census Bureau. To mitigate the omitted-variable bias, in my regression analysis, I control for real GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation rate, real interest rate, corporate tax rate, population growth rate, House majority party, and Senate majority party. The findings suggest… These results provide new insights into the intersection of politics and entrepreneurship, with implications for both economic policy and business strategies…

It is widely believed that the economic performance of the US is linked to the political affiliation of the incumbent president, with several studies suggesting that economic growth tends to be faster under Democratic administrations. While much of the existing literature has focused on traditional indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, international trade, stock market return, and equity market liquidity, few have examined business creation—a key indicator of economic vitality—as a dependent variable. This study seeks to address this gap by analyzing the relationship between the political affiliation of US presidents and the annual number of new businesses formed from 1978 to 2021, using data from the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) published by the US Census Bureau. To ensure the robustness of the analysis and minimize omitted-variable bias, the regression model controls for a range of economic and political factors, including real GDP growth, unemployment, inflation, real interest rates, corporate tax rates, population growth, and the composition of Congress (House and Senate majorities). The results indicate that… These findings not only contribute to the ongoing debate on the economic impact of political leadership but also offer insights that could inform business strategy, particularly regarding entrepreneurship and small business development.
