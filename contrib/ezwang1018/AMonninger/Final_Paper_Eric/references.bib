               announcement days. The current study unifies the two strands of
               literature by documenting that statistically significant and
               economically large announcement-day U.S. equity premiums have
               been limited to periods of Democratic administration between 1964
               and 2015. On announcement days in Republican administrations, the
               estimated equity premium accompanying news announcements was
               negligible. The Democratic announcement-day equity premium was
               consistently positive in sub-periods; it showed up in
               international markets; it increased as election day approached;
               it appeared to be stronger for announcements in successive
               Democratic administrations; and it was bigger for medium and
               large market cap stocks than for small market caps stocks on
               announcement days, even though small stocks have in general
               beaten large stocks under Democratic presidents. At the same
               time, we show that FOMC announcements in the 1990-2015 sub-period
               were associated with positive equity premiums in both Democratic
               (Clinton and Obama) and Republican (G.W. Bush) administrations;

  abstract  = "This paper examines the extent to which the positive relationship
               between personal wealth and entry into entrepreneurship is due to
               financing constraints. I exploit a tax reform and use unique
               micro-data from Denmark to study how exogenous changes in the
               cost of external finance shape both the probability of entering
               entrepreneurship and the characteristics of those who become
               entrepreneurs. As expected, differences-in-differences estimates
               show that the entry rates for individuals who faced an increase
               in the cost of finance fell by 40\% relative to those whose cost
               of external finance was unchanged. However, while some of the
               fall in entry was due to less wealthy individuals with high human
               capital (confirming the presence of financing constraints), the
               greatest relative decline in entry came from individuals with
               lower human capital, many of whom were above median wealth. This
               finding suggests that an important part of the positive
               relationship between personal wealth and entrepreneurship may be
               driven by the fact that wealthy individuals with lower ability
               can start new businesses because they are less likely to face the
               disciplining effect of external finance.",

               impact of partisanship on the taxation of firms. In this article,
               I show that although left-leaning governments set tax rates at
               higher levels than right-leaning governments, the difference in
               the effective tax rates paid by firms is much less dramatic
               between left and right governments. I argue that left-leaning
               governments maintain high tax rates, a visible policy their
               constituency supports, while allowing firms to transfer profits
               abroad to minimize their tax burden (transfer pricing).
               Constituency costs hinder them from cutting tax rates to avoid
               backlash from voters, but they impose fewer restrictions on
               profit-shifting to attract investment by multinational firms for
               economic growth. Data covering 19 advanced economies between 2006
               and 2009 support my theoretical expectation. My analyses suggest
               that the effect of government partisanship on corporate tax
               policy can be ambiguous when political parties consider various
               policy tools.",
